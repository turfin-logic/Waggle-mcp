"""Measure event-loop stall caused by synchronous ``embed()`` calls.

Part of the *async embedding* work (sub-issue 2 of 2).

We claim that calling ``EmbeddingModel.embed`` synchronously inside an async request handler blocks the event loop, starving lightweight requests (health checks, ``get_stats``).
This module quantifies that stall so the problem is visible and so the thread-pool-executor fix can be shown to help.

How it works
------------
A "heartbeat" coroutine ticks every ``HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL`` seconds and records the largest gap between successive ticks.
Each tick stands in for a lightweight request: the gap is how long such a request would have waited to be serviced.
While the heartbeat runs we drive one embed-heavy ``add_node`` through two code paths:

- ``blocking``: mirrors the current ``graph_create_node`` ASGI handler, which calls ``graph.add_node(...)`` (and therefore ``embed``) directly on the loop.
- ``threaded``: mirrors the proposed fix, wrapping that same call in ``asyncio.to_thread`` so the blocking work runs off the loop.

The real model is never loaded. We use the deterministic embedder and patch ``EmbeddingModel.embed`` to ``time.sleep`` for a fixed interval, so the test
measures event-loop responsiveness (not model speed) and runs anywhere with no 400 MB download.

Run with ``-s`` to see the reported numbers:
